# Task goals
- Draw solution architecture diagram for your deployment.
- Diagram must be as complete as possible, as it was for production.
- Note that the actual IaC deployment does not need to be production ready (no custom Domain etc.).
- Include as annotations all DNS, IP, TLS, Port and other critical details.
- Use diagram tool like: draw.io, Lucidchart, etc.
- Use AWS/Azure calculator to estimate costs.
