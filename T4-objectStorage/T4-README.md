# Task goals
- Create and configure Public Object Storage container
- Create and configure Protected Object Storage container
- Upload test files to Public container by using CLI
- Upload test files to Protected container by using CLI
- Include screenshots about Public and Protected containers with test files to task README.txt


# Deploying
You can either copy the `*.tf` files in this folder to your machine of choice, navigate into the folder, initialise terraform from there:
```
$ terraform init
```
And then apply (to create resources):
```
$ terraform apply
```
This will effectively **only** create resources that are specified in this folder.       

## OR
You can **download** the main `/terraform` **folder** to your computer **locally** **-->** **navigate to the folder** **-->** and **execute the same steps:** to provision the whole infra in one go!
