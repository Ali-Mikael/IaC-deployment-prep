Using this directory will create you a VPC and necessary components for testing purposes.

Right now it includes the option to experiment with AMIs.

You can create your custom AMI, and then launch an instance from that AMI.
Code is commented regarding this.

Only thing you have to do is navigate to this directory, 
and run terraform init && terraform apply.

REMEMBER to config your own SSH keys!!!
Also: You have to uncomment the section for AMI creation.
See code for more.
